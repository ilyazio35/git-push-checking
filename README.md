# ðŸŽ“ Student Grading System (C++)

This is a basic **C++ console application** that represents a simple Student Grading System. It allows you to input a student's information and calculates their grade based on the marks entered.

> ðŸ“Œ This project was mainly created to **test Git version control and pushing code to GitHub** from CLion.
